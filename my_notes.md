- Python is a strongly typed language. This means that every object in the language has a definite type, and there’s generally no way to circumvent that type.
- Python is dynamically typed, meaning that there’s no type-checking of your code prior to running it.
- The best description of the Python type system is that it uses duck-typing where an object’s suitability for a context is only determined at runtime.

  - clarity

- Readability
  - use white spaces to make your code readable

- Functions
  - if you don't have an explicit return in a function, python adds one for you. And the function returns None
  - During runtime python makes available some special variables and attributes. These attributes delimited by double underscores
  - __name__ is a special attribute that gives you the name of the module

- Modules
  - Any .py file is considered a python module
  - Make simpler code importable

  - import has any effect the first time you import it in REPL (or any program)

### Python Execution model

- def isn't a declaration, it's a statement
- During runtime def is executed with all the top level codes and bind the code body to the function name
- When modules are executed all the top level codes run (including def)
