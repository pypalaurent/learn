- Python is a strongly typed language. This means that every object in the language has a definite type, and there’s generally no way to circumvent that type.
- Python is dynamically typed, meaning that there’s no type-checking of your code prior to running it.
- The best description of the Python type system is that it uses duck-typing where an object’s suitability for a context is only determined at runtime.
